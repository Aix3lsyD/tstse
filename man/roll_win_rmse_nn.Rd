\title{Rolling Window RMSE for Neural Network Forecasts}
\usage{
roll_win_rmse_nn(x, horizon = 1L, model, plot = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector or ts object, the time series.}

\item{horizon}{Integer, forecast horizon (default 1).}

\item{model}{An mlp model object from the nnfor package.}

\item{plot}{Logical, whether to plot histogram of RMSEs (default TRUE).}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to print progress messages (default FALSE).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\item{rmse}{Mean RMSE across all windows}
\item{mse}{Mean MSE across all windows}
\item{rmse_all}{Vector of RMSE for each window}
\item{mse_all}{Vector of MSE for each window}
\item{n_windows}{Number of rolling windows used}
\item{horizon}{Forecast horizon}
\item{frequency}{Series frequency}
\item{diff_order}{Differencing order from model}
}
\description{
Evaluate forecast accuracy of an MLP model using rolling window cross-validation.
}
\details{
For non-seasonal models, performs true rolling window evaluation across
multiple windows. For seasonal models (with seasonal dummies), only
evaluates on the last window due to MLP recalculating seasonal components.

The training window size is determined by the model's lag structure and
differencing order, with a minimum of 9 observations.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit an MLP model
library(nnfor)
fit <- mlp(AirPassengers)

# Evaluate with rolling window
result <- roll_win_rmse_nn(AirPassengers, horizon = 12, model = fit)
print(result$rmse)
}
