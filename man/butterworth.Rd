\title{Butterworth Filter for Time Series}
\usage{
butterworth(
  x,
  order = 4L,
  type = c("low", "high", "stop", "pass"),
  cutoff,
  plot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector, the time series to filter.}

\item{order}{Integer, filter order (default 4).}

\item{type}{Character, filter type: "low", "high", "stop", or "pass".}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric, cutoff frequency as a fraction of Nyquist frequency (0 to 0.5).
For "low" and "high" filters, a scalar value.
For "stop" and "pass" filters, a 2-element vector with lower and upper cutoffs.}

\item{plot}{Logical, whether to plot original and filtered series (default TRUE).}
}
\value{
A list with component:
\item{x_filt}{The filtered time series}
}
\description{
Apply a Butterworth filter to a time series using zero-phase filtering.
}
\details{
This function wraps the \code{signal} package's \code{butter} and \code{filtfilt}
functions to apply a zero-phase Butterworth filter.

The cutoff frequency is specified as a fraction of the Nyquist frequency
(half the sampling rate). For example, if your data is sampled at 100 Hz
and you want a 10 Hz lowpass filter, use \code{cutoff = 10/50 = 0.2}.

Filter types:
\describe{
\item{low}{Lowpass filter - passes frequencies below cutoff}
\item{high}{Highpass filter - passes frequencies above cutoff}
\item{stop}{Bandstop filter - removes frequencies between cutoffs}
\item{pass}{Bandpass filter - passes frequencies between cutoffs}
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate noisy signal
t <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 200)
x <- sin(2 * pi * 5 * t) + 0.5 * sin(2 * pi * 50 * t)

# Lowpass filter to remove high frequency component
result <- butterworth(x, order = 4, type = "low", cutoff = 0.2)

# Highpass filter
result <- butterworth(x, order = 4, type = "high", cutoff = 0.3, plot = FALSE)

# Bandpass filter
result <- butterworth(x, order = 4, type = "pass", cutoff = c(0.1, 0.3))
