\title{Create Likelihood Ratio Statistic Function}
\usage{
make_stat_lr(order = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{order}{Integer. The AR order for the models. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A function that takes a numeric vector \code{x} and returns
the likelihood ratio statistic: \eqn{2 \cdot (\ell_1 - \ell_0)}
where \eqn{\ell_1} is the log-likelihood with trend and \eqn{\ell_0}
is without.
}
\description{
Creates a function that computes the likelihood ratio test statistic
for trend by comparing AR models with and without a linear trend term.
}
\details{
Under the null hypothesis of no trend, the likelihood ratio statistic
is asymptotically chi-squared with 1 degree of freedom. However, when
used within the bootstrap framework, the empirical null distribution
is used instead, which handles autocorrelation appropriately.
}
\examples{
stat_fn <- make_stat_lr(order = 2)

set.seed(123)
x <- 0.1 * (1:100) + arima.sim(list(ar = 0.7), n = 100)
stat_fn(x)  # Likelihood ratio statistic
