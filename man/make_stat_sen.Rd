\title{Create Sen's Slope Statistic Function}
\usage{
make_stat_sen()
}
\value{
A function that takes a numeric vector \code{x} and returns
Sen's slope estimate.
}
\description{
Creates a function that computes Sen's slope estimator, which is the
median of all pairwise slopes. This is a robust, non-parametric
estimate of trend magnitude.
}
\details{
Sen's slope is defined as the median of all slopes computed between
pairs of points:
\deqn{\beta = \text{median}\left(\frac{x_j - x_i}{j - i}\right)}
for all \eqn{i < j}.

This is more robust to outliers than OLS slope estimation.
}
\examples{
stat_fn <- make_stat_sen()

set.seed(123)
x <- 0.1 * (1:100) + rnorm(100)
stat_fn(x)  # Should be close to 0.1
