\title{Create a Student's t Innovation Generator}
\usage{
make_gen_t(df, scale = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Degrees of freedom. Must be > 2 for finite variance when
\code{scale = TRUE}.}

\item{scale}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, scale to unit variance.
Requires \code{df > 2}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A function with signature \code{function(n)} that generates
\code{n} t-distributed innovations with mean zero.
}
\description{
Factory function that returns a t-distributed innovation generator.
Optionally scales output to have unit variance for comparability
with normal innovations.
}
\details{
The variance of a t-distribution with \code{df} degrees of freedom is
\code{df / (df - 2)} for \code{df > 2}. When \code{scale = TRUE}, the
output is divided by \code{sqrt(df / (df - 2))} to achieve unit variance.

For \code{df <= 2}, the variance is infinite, so scaling is not possible
and will be disabled with a warning.

Heavy-tailed innovations are useful for simulating financial returns
and other processes where extreme values occur more frequently than
a normal distribution predicts.
}
\examples{
# Heavy-tailed innovations (df = 5)
t_gen <- make_gen_t(df = 5)
innovations <- t_gen(1000)
var(innovations)

# Scaled to unit variance
t_gen_scaled <- make_gen_t(df = 5, scale = TRUE)
var(t_gen_scaled(1000))

# Very heavy tails (df = 3)
t_gen_heavy <- make_gen_t(df = 3)
}
