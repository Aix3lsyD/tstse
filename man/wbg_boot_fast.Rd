\title{Fast WBG Bootstrap Test for Trend (C++ Implementation)}
\usage{
wbg_boot_fast(
  x,
  nb = 399L,
  maxp = 5L,
  criterion = c("aic", "aicc", "bic"),
  bootadj = FALSE,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector containing the time series data.}

\item{nb}{Number of bootstrap replicates. Default is 399.}

\item{maxp}{Maximum AR order for model selection. Default is 5.}

\item{criterion}{Character. Information criterion for order selection:
\code{"aic"}, \code{"aicc"}, or \code{"bic"}. Default is \code{"aic"}.}

\item{bootadj}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, performs the COBA (Cochrane-Orcutt
Bootstrap Adjustment) variance adjustment for improved small-sample
performance. Default is \code{FALSE} for maximum speed.}

\item{seed}{Integer, random seed for reproducibility. Default NULL.}
}
\value{
A list of class "wbg_boot_fast" containing:
\item{p}{AR order selected for the series under null hypothesis.}
\item{phi}{AR coefficients for the null model.}
\item{vara}{Innovation variance for the null model.}
\item{pvalue}{Bootstrap p-value for trend test (two-sided).}
\item{tco_obs}{Observed t-statistic from Cochrane-Orcutt fit.}
\item{boot_tstats}{Vector of bootstrap t-statistics.}
\item{n}{Length of input series.}
\item{nb}{Number of bootstrap replicates used.}
\item{maxp}{Maximum AR order considered.}
\item{criterion}{Information criterion used.}

If \code{bootadj = TRUE}, also includes:
\item{tco_obs_adj}{COBA-adjusted observed t-statistic.}
\item{pvalue_adj}{COBA-adjusted two-sided p-value.}
\item{adj_factor}{Variance adjustment factor (C from paper).}
\item{median_phi}{AR coefficients from the median bootstrap model.}

\description{
High-performance bootstrap hypothesis test for trend in time series.
Uses the Woodward-Bottone-Gray (WBG) method with C++ parallelization
via TBB (Intel Threading Building Blocks).
}
\details{
This is a high-performance C++ implementation of \code{\link[=wbg_boot]{wbg_boot()}},
optimized for large-scale applications. Key differences:

\itemize{
\item Uses Burg algorithm only (most stable for bootstrap)
\item Parallelization via TBB (works on all platforms)
\item All bootstrap iterations run in C++ (no R overhead)
\item Thread-safe RNG (dqrng with xoshiro256+)
}

Expected speedup is 10-25x compared to \code{\link[=wbg_boot]{wbg_boot()}} depending on
series length and number of available CPU cores.

The bootstrap procedure:
\enumerate{
\item Fit Cochrane-Orcutt model to observed data using C++
\item Fit AR(p) model under null hypothesis (no trend)
\item Generate \code{nb} bootstrap series from AR(p) in parallel
\item Compute CO t-statistic for each bootstrap series
\item p-value = proportion of |bootstrap t| >= |observed t|
}

\strong{COBA Adjustment:}
When \code{bootadj = TRUE}, a second-stage bootstrap adjusts the observed
statistic for variance inflation caused by AR coefficient estimation
bias. This provides better small-sample significance levels but
approximately doubles computation time. The adjustment uses the median
AR coefficients from the first stage, where the "median" is selected
based on phi(1) = 1 - sum(phi) as described in the original paper.
