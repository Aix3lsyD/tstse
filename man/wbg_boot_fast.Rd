\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector containing the time series data.}

\item{nb}{Number of bootstrap replicates. Default is 399.}

\item{maxp}{Maximum AR order for Cochrane-Orcutt model selection. Default is 5.}

\item{criterion}{Character. Information criterion for order selection:
\code{"aic"}, \code{"aicc"}, or \code{"bic"}. Default is \code{"aic"}.}

\item{bootadj}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, performs the two-stage bootstrap
adjustment (variance correction) for improved small-sample performance.
Default is \code{FALSE} for maximum speed.}

\item{pw_stat}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, also computes Prais-Winsten t-statistics
alongside the Cochrane-Orcutt statistics. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{maxp_pw}{Maximum AR order for Prais-Winsten (typically 1 for AR(1)).
Default is 1. Only used when \code{pw_stat = TRUE}.}

\description{
High-performance bootstrap hypothesis test for trend in time series.
Uses the Woodward-Bottone-Gray (WBG) method with C++ parallelization
via TBB (Intel Threading Building Blocks).
}
\details{
This is a high-performance C++ implementation of \code{\link[=wbg_boot]{wbg_boot()}},
optimized for large-scale applications. Key differences:

\itemize{
\item Uses Burg algorithm only (most stable for bootstrap)
\item Parallelization via TBB (works on all platforms)
\item All bootstrap iterations run in C++ (no R overhead)
\item Thread-safe RNG (dqrng with xoshiro256+)
}

Expected speedup is 10-25x compared to \code{\link[=wbg_boot]{wbg_boot()}} depending on
series length and number of available CPU cores.

The bootstrap procedure:
\enumerate{
\item Fit Cochrane-Orcutt model to observed data using C++
\item Fit AR(p) model under null hypothesis (no trend)
\item Generate \code{nb} bootstrap series from AR(p) in parallel
\item Compute CO t-statistic for each bootstrap series
\item p-value = proportion of |bootstrap t| >= |observed t|
}

\strong{Bootstrap Adjustment:}
When \code{bootadj = TRUE}, a second-stage bootstrap adjusts the observed
statistic for variance inflation caused by AR coefficient estimation
bias. This provides better small-sample significance levels but
approximately doubles computation time. The adjustment uses the median
AR coefficients from the first stage, where the "median" is selected
based on phi(1) = 1 - sum(phi) as described in the original paper.

\strong{Performance Tuning:}
For optimal parallel performance, you may want to disable BLAS multi-threading
to avoid nested parallelism (TBB threads + BLAS threads). Set these environment
variables \strong{before loading any packages} that use BLAS:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{Sys.setenv(
  VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS = "1",
  OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS = "1",
  MKL_NUM_THREADS = "1",
  OMP_NUM_THREADS = "1",
  BLAS_NUM_THREADS = "1"
)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

On macOS with Apple Accelerate, \code{VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS} is the key variable.
Note: These must be set early in the R session (before BLAS initializes) to
take effect. A session restart may be required after changing them.
