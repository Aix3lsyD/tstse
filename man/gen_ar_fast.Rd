\title{Fast AR Series Generator}
\usage{
gen_ar_fast(n, phi = numeric(0), vara = 1, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Length of output series.}

\item{phi}{Numeric vector. AR coefficients (same sign convention as
\code{gen_arma()} and \code{arima.sim()}).}

\item{vara}{Numeric. White noise variance. Default is 1.}

\item{seed}{Integer or NULL. Random seed for reproducibility. If NULL
(default), no seed is set.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length \code{n}.
}
\description{
Generates AR(p) realizations optimized for bootstrap applications.
Uses adaptive burn-in and the C-implemented \code{stats::filter()} for
efficient recursive filtering. Provides ~30-50x speedup over general
ARMA generators for pure AR series.
}
\details{
This function is optimized for generating many AR series quickly,
as needed in bootstrap applications. Key optimizations include:

\itemize{
\item \strong{Adaptive burn-in}: Adjusts based on AR persistence rather
than using a fixed value. Near-unit-root models get longer burn-in.
\item \strong{C-level filtering}: Uses \code{stats::filter()} which is
implemented in C for recursive filtering.
\item \strong{No plotting overhead}: Unlike \code{gen_arma()}, no plot is
generated.
\item \strong{Pure AR only}: No MA/ARMA overhead.
}

The adaptive burn-in strategy:
\itemize{
\item If \verb{sum(|phi|) >= 0.999} (near unit root): burn-in is
\code{max(50, n/2, 500)}, capped at 2000
\item If \verb{sum(|phi|) < 0.01} (nearly white noise): burn-in is 50
\item Otherwise: burn-in is based on decay rate, \verb{3 * |log(0.001)/log(persistence)|}
}
}
\examples{
# Generate AR(1) with phi = 0.9
set.seed(123)
x <- gen_ar_fast(200, phi = 0.9)
plot(x, type = "l")

# Generate AR(2)
x <- gen_ar_fast(200, phi = c(0.5, 0.3), seed = 456)

# White noise (phi = 0 or empty)
wn <- gen_ar_fast(100, phi = numeric(0))

# Near unit root - gets longer burn-in automatically
x_persistent <- gen_ar_fast(200, phi = 0.99, seed = 789)
