\title{Wigner-Ville Distribution}
\usage{
wv(x, n_freq = 101L, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. The time series to analyze.}

\item{n_freq}{Integer. Number of frequency points (0 to 0.5). Default is 101.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), plot the time-frequency image.}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"wv"} containing:
\item{tfr}{Matrix of the time-frequency representation. Rows are frequencies,
columns are time points.}
\item{freq}{Numeric vector of frequencies (0 to 0.5).}
\item{time}{Numeric vector of time indices.}
}
\description{
Computes and optionally plots the Wigner-Ville distribution, a time-frequency
representation of a signal useful for analyzing non-stationary time series.
}
\details{
The Wigner-Ville distribution is a quadratic time-frequency representation
defined as:
\deqn{W_x(t, f) = \sum_{\tau} x(t + \tau) x^*(t - \tau) e^{-j 2\pi f \tau}}

where \eqn{x^*} denotes the complex conjugate. The function first computes
the analytic signal using the Hilbert transform, then computes the
Wigner-Ville distribution.

The Wigner-Ville distribution provides high resolution in both time and
frequency simultaneously, but can exhibit cross-term interference for
multi-component signals.
}
\section{Interpretation}{

\itemize{
\item Bright regions indicate high energy at that time-frequency location
\item Horizontal bands suggest stationary frequency components
\item Diagonal or curved patterns indicate frequency modulation (chirps)
\item Cross-terms (interference) may appear between signal components
}
}

\examples{
# Chirp signal (frequency increases over time)
t <- 1:256
x <- cos(2 * pi * (0.05 * t + 0.0002 * t^2))
result <- wv(x)

# Sum of two sinusoids
x2 <- cos(2 * pi * 0.1 * t) + cos(2 * pi * 0.3 * t)
result2 <- wv(x2)

# Just compute, no plot
result3 <- wv(x, plot = FALSE)
dim(result3$tfr)
