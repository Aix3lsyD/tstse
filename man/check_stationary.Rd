\title{Check if AR Model is Stationary}
\usage{
check_stationary(phi, tol = 1.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{phi}{Numeric vector of AR coefficients.}

\item{tol}{Numeric. Roots must have modulus > tol to be considered
outside the unit circle. Default is 1.001 to provide a small buffer.}
}
\value{
Logical. TRUE if stationary, FALSE otherwise.
}
\description{
Checks whether an AR model with given coefficients is stationary by
verifying all roots of the characteristic polynomial lie outside the
unit circle.
}
\details{
An AR(p) process with coefficients \eqn{\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_p} is
stationary if all roots of the characteristic polynomial
\deqn{1 - \phi_1 z - \phi_2 z^2 - \cdots - \phi_p z^p = 0}
lie outside the unit circle (i.e., have modulus > 1).

The default tolerance of 1.001 provides a small buffer to handle
numerical precision issues and avoid near-unit-root edge cases.

\examples{
# Stationary AR(1)
check_stationary(0.9)        # TRUE
check_stationary(0.5)        # TRUE

# Non-stationary (unit root)
check_stationary(1.0)        # FALSE
check_stationary(1.01)       # FALSE

# Stationary AR(2)
check_stationary(c(0.5, 0.3))  # TRUE

# White noise (empty phi is trivially stationary)
check_stationary(numeric(0))  # TRUE
