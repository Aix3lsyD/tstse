\title{Multiply Polynomial Factors}
\usage{
mult(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Numeric vectors, each representing factor coefficients.
For example, for factor (1 - 0.8B), pass \code{c(0.8)}.
For factor (1 - 1.6B + 0.9B^2), pass \code{c(1.6, -0.9)}.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\item{model_coef}{Combined model coefficients (excluding leading 1)}
\item{poly_coef}{Full polynomial coefficients (including leading 1)}
\item{char_poly}{Polynomial object (if PolynomF available, otherwise NULL)}
}
\description{
Multiply AR or MA polynomial factors together to get combined coefficients.
}
\details{
Takes factors of the form (1 - phi_1 B - phi_2 B^2 - ...) and multiplies
them together. Input each factor's coefficients (phi_1, phi_2, ...) as
a numeric vector.

If the \code{PolynomF} package is installed, it will be used and a polynomial
object returned in \code{char_poly}. Otherwise, falls back to base R convolution.
}
\examples{
# Two AR(1) factors: (1 - 0.8B)(1 - 0.5B)
mult(c(0.8), c(0.5))

# AR(1) and AR(2) factor: (1 - 0.7B)(1 - 1.2B + 0.6B^2)
mult(c(0.7), c(1.2, -0.6))
